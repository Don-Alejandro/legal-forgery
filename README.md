legal-forgery is a program that will recognize patterns in handwriting samples; thereafter, it will output similar
handwriting onto a piece of paper via a MakeBlock XY Plotter.

{Characteristic Handwriting Samples are "deciphered"} --> {input prose is given to Plotter} --> {XY Plotter prints
the paragraph, which looks like the original provider of sample's handwriting}

Brainstorm. Here is a list of characteristics that define an individual's handwriting:

  letter shape
  
  handedness
  
  segmentation/flow. 

I/f/the/hu/man/b/rain/were/so/s/imple/that/we/could/un/derstand/it/we/would/be/so/s/imple/that/we/wouldn't.

  how are specific amounts of letters connected together?
  
  pressure
  
  capitals 
  
  amplitude and width of letters on a line
  
  outlires 
  
  possibly randomize dotting of i's and crossing of t's to make writing seem more authentic. Allow some error in height, placement
  
  cases: two letter words, repeated letters "tt"
  
  spacing between words
